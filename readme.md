# short Q: Software Maintenance

**Software Maintenance** refers to the process of modifying, updating, and improving software after it has been deployed to fix issues, enhance functionality, or adapt it to changes in its environment. It is crucial because software is rarely perfect at launch, and ongoing maintenance ensures it continues to meet user needs and works correctly over time.

### Types of Software Maintenance:

1. **Corrective Maintenance:**
   - **What it is**: This type of maintenance is performed to fix bugs or issues that were discovered after the software was released. These bugs can range from minor glitches to major malfunctions.
   - **Example**: A bug that causes an app to crash when the user tries to open a specific feature is fixed through corrective maintenance.

2. **Adaptive Maintenance:**
   - **What it is**: Adaptive maintenance involves modifying the software to work with changes in the environment where the software runs. This could involve changes in hardware, operating systems, or software platforms that the application depends on.
   - **Example**: If a mobile app needs to be updated to work with a new version of the operating system (like iOS or Android), that's adaptive maintenance.

3. **Perfective Maintenance:**
   - **What it is**: This type of maintenance aims to enhance the software by improving its performance, adding new features, or making it easier to use. It’s often driven by user feedback or requests.
   - **Example**: Adding a new feature to a web application, like a search bar or chat functionality, would be part of perfective maintenance.

4. **Preventive Maintenance:**
   - **What it is**: Preventive maintenance focuses on making changes to the software to avoid potential future problems. It’s more about anticipating issues and fixing them before they occur.
   - **Example**: Refactoring code to make it cleaner and more efficient to prevent future bugs or issues would be an example of preventive maintenance.

# Refactored BankAccount Class

## Code Explanation

### Refactoring Steps:

1. **Encapsulation**: The `Balance`, `AccountNumber`, and `Owner` fields are now private and managed via public properties and methods.
2. **Class Responsibility**: The logic related to user interaction (`Console.ReadLine()`) is separated from the core functionality of the `BankAccount` class.
3. **Transaction Handling**: Introduced a `Transaction` class to better manage transactions.
4. **Improved Readability**: Cleaned up hard-coded values and made the code more reusable and extendable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Refactored Code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace BankApp
{
    public class BankAccount
    {
        // Properties of BankAccount
        public int AccountNumber { get; private set; }
        public string Owner { get; private set; }
        public decimal Balance { get; private set; }

        private static int accountNumberSeed = 1234567890;
        private List<Transaction> allTransactions = new List<Transaction>();

        // Constructor
        public BankAccount(string owner, decimal initialBalance)
        {
            AccountNumber = accountNumberSeed++;
            Owner = owner;
            if (initialBalance > 0)
            {
                Balance = initialBalance;
            }
            else
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Initial balance must be positive");
            }
        }

        // Deposit Method
        public void Deposit(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount <= 0)
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Deposit amount must be positive");
            }

            Balance += amount;
            allTransactions.Add(new Transaction(TransactionType.Deposit, amount));
        }

        // Withdraw Method
        public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount <= 0)
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("Withdrawal amount must be positive");
            }

            if (Balance - amount < 0)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Insufficient funds for this withdrawal");
            }

            Balance -= amount;
            allTransactions.Add(new Transaction(TransactionType.Withdrawal, amount));
        }

        // Get account information
        public string GetAccountInfo()
        {
            return $"Account Number: {AccountNumber}, Owner: {Owner}, Balance: {Balance:C}";
        }
    }

    // Transaction class to track individual transactions
    public class Transaction
    {
        public TransactionType Type { get; private set; }
        public decimal Amount { get; private set; }
        public DateTime Date { get; private set; }

        public Transaction(TransactionType type, decimal amount)
        {
            Type = type;
            Amount = amount;
            Date = DateTime.Now;
        }
    }

    // Enum for transaction types
    public enum TransactionType
    {
        Deposit,
        Withdrawal
    }

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Example of using BankAccount
            BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Ali", 1000);
            Console.WriteLine(account.GetAccountInfo());

            // Simulate a deposit
            account.Deposit(500);
            Console.WriteLine(account.GetAccountInfo());

            // Simulate a withdrawal
            account.Withdraw(200);
            Console.WriteLine(account.GetAccountInfo());

            // Trying to withdraw more than balance (error case)
            try
            {
                account.Withdraw(2000);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}

```

# Key Refactoring Improvements

## BankAccount Class:
1. **Encapsulation**: 
   - `Balance`, `AccountNumber`, and `Owner` are now private fields with public properties. This means that these fields are hidden from the outside, and access is provided through methods or properties to ensure better control over the data.
   
2. **Deposit() and Withdraw() Methods**: 
   - These methods ensure valid operations and modify the account balance. The `Deposit()` method adds money to the balance, while the `Withdraw()` method ensures that the withdrawal doesn't result in a negative balance.

## Transaction Class:
- A `Transaction` class has been introduced to track individual transactions (deposit and withdrawal). This makes the code more modular and easier to extend in the future. Each transaction stores its type (deposit or withdrawal), amount, and date.

## Error Handling:
- Exception handling ensures proper validation of inputs and raises appropriate errors for invalid operations. For example, if the withdrawal amount is greater than the balance, an exception is thrown, preventing the operation from completing and ensuring the system behaves as expected.

## Use of Enums:
- The `TransactionType` enum helps distinguish between deposit and withdrawal transactions for better clarity. It makes the code more readable and self-explanatory, as we use meaningful names instead of arbitrary values for transaction types.

## User Interaction:
- The `Program` class handles user input and interaction with the bank account. The `BankAccount` class is responsible for all the operations related to the account itself (like deposits, withdrawals, and balance management). This separation ensures that the logic for account management is independent of user input, improving the overall maintainability of the code.

   - **Identification**: The system needs to integrate with speech recognition APIs or use existing voice technology libraries.
   - **Change Control**: Evaluate if adding voice support impacts the user interface, authentication, or data flow. Approval of such a change could require testing and system design updates.
   - **Version Control**: The change could be implemented in a separate branch (e.g., `voice_integration`) and merged after testing.
   - **Release Management**: Deploy the feature after successful integration and ensure it doesn’t disrupt existing functionality.

### 2. **System Scanning and Searching Items (Change Request #2):**
   - **Identification**: Identify which external sources the system should scan for item availability (e.g., supplier databases, inventory systems).
   - **Change Control**: Assess the technical feasibility and impact of integrating with external APIs or databases. Ensure that security, performance, and reliability are considered before approval.
   - **Version Control**: Implement changes in a feature branch (e.g., `item_scanning`) and ensure it doesn’t interfere with the core functionality of the shopping cart.
   - **Release Management**: Release the feature incrementally to ensure any issues in fetching data can be addressed without affecting users.

### 3. **Most Ordered Item Suggestion (Change Request #3):**
   - **Identification**: Determine how to track and store most ordered items in a way that can support discounts and deals.
   - **Change Control**: Approve the development of a recommendation system or feature that suggests popular items to users based on past orders.
   - **Version Control**: Track changes in a new branch, ensuring that new algorithms don’t break the checkout or cart functionalities.
   - **Release Management**: Deploy the update as part of the new release with the voice communication and item scanning features.

---

## Conclusion:
To manage change requests effectively, Software Configuration Management (SCM) must ensure that changes are properly documented, reviewed, implemented, and tested without disrupting the ongoing development of the system. Change requests like adding voice communication, scanning items from external sources, and adding item suggestions require careful analysis, testing, and version control to integrate smoothly into the Pizza Ordering System.
